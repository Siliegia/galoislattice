# galoislattice
A R package to create Galois lattices for two-mode networks and analyze them. By using a reduced label for directed galois lattices,
the positional dominance of the original network can be extracted. 

This package depends on the R package igraph.

## Installation

You can install galoislattice from github with:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Siliegia/galoislattice")
```
