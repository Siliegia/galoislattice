Title: Galois Lattice and Positional Dominance
Version: 0.1
Author: Maria Mircea
Date: 2017-03-06
Description: Builds a Galois lattice of a binary two-mode network. It can be
    used to identify hierarchical structures in the data. A dominance tree can
    be build which describes the positional dominance between nodes by using the
    shortest paths. Also a hierarchical layout is included to see the structure
    accordingly.
